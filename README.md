Submitted by: Jeremiah Soe

Time spent: ~1 hour spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Applications:
- X (formerly Twitter)
    - Simple UI
    - Impressive algorithm that adapts to user's interests with a simple refresh
    - Filter what you want to see on your feed (block, mute)
- Instagram
    - Simple UI
    - Various unique camera features such as filters
    - Messaging features such as changing chat themes, reactions, etc.
- Strong
    - PR (personal record) tracker
    - Rest Timer
    - Various exercises already included, with short videos to show the movement

App Idea:
I would like to build a workout tracker app that also includes additional features when used with an Apple Watch. As listed above, one of my favorite apps is Strong. I think I could improve on this concept as it seems to lack some features, such as modifying previous workouts and it's functionality with it's Apple Watch companion app is very basic. I would want to include a "Rep Counter" with the Apple Watch app that utilizes information about the user's arm position to count a rep when certain conditions are met (perhaps signal using a vibration when your target number of reps are done?). 

## Notes
Some basic issues encountered while learning how to use Github Desktop on my MacBook Air; these are noted in my GitHub commits.
